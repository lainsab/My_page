		<h2>Building my own website</h2>
		<p> I started creating my own website as a project in a course during my studies at Haaga-Helia, University od Applied Sciences 2023.</p>
		<p>The goal of the project was to learn the basics of designing a mobile-first webpage development. You could for example a company you wanted to build the page for, or then create a page for yourself, to act as portfolio of your work.</p>
		<p>I chose the latter, and desided to work on building my own website.</p>
		<p>I started my project with a very simple and fast sketch of how I would like the page to look like, and then continued to do a high-fidelity version on Figma</p>
		<section>
			<p>The first versions looked like this, hand-drawn</p>

			<br /><p>When working with Figma I started with a very basic layout, and choosing of the header and footer color.</p>

			<br /><p>I started the coding process with the help of freecodecamp.com, W3School and a book I have, called HTML&CSS:design and websites by Jon Duckett.</p>
			<p>The process has been very helpfull in me learning how to build a website, but I am not quite there yet.</p>
